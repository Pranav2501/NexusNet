## Peer Review
Hello Pranav! This is Siyuan Liu/Cathy, and I'm adding this file to write my peer review. :)  
You did a really good job and I'm impressed when I see your work. I'm really happy that I could modify my own profile and upload pictures just like what I can do in other social media platform.  
I found several bugs in your code, just would like you to know:
1. I have some problem getting images from the server, although I'm not sure why ![A6D)~E$ZMB8SB@UAY$KOF}L](https://github.com/Pranav2501/NexusNet/assets/86466699/af50e735-e950-4642-b4d3-0d882a56376f)
2. If I update my profile without typing something in the bio, I will get an error in the console ![APNSX_%FZL~@%W}JJ76K4HA](https://github.com/Pranav2501/NexusNet/assets/86466699/5b505f2c-5114-429d-9887-75ac3e46281e)
3. I accidentally sign up twice for the same email and username, and when I search for my username I'll get two result ![RZ@DP4UCHF _CV Y(UCNAGM](https://github.com/Pranav2501/NexusNet/assets/86466699/7e91a869-9cc2-46a1-8b2a-146b0d961f65)
